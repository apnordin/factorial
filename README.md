This is a Node CLI that I created to quickly practice recursive code with factorials. To run, just install inquirer using npm i and then run `node index`. You will be prompted to enter an integer, and then the value of that integer's factorial will be displayed via console log.

Basically the whole point of this is to have fun with line 6, where the `fact()` function is called within the `fact()` function.
