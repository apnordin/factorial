This is a Node CLI that I created to quickly practice recursive code. To run, just install inquirer with `npm i` and then run `node index`.

First, you will be prompted to either `Calculate a factorial` or `Calculate the number at a certain position of the Fibonacci sequence`.

- If you choose the former, you will be prompted to enter an integer, and then the value of that integer's factorial will be displayed via console log.
- If you choose the latter, you can then select whether you would like to use a foor loop or recursive code to calculate. Then just enter an integer, and the value at that position of the Fibonacci sequence will be displayed.
  - Please note: for the user display, this sequence is ordered with a starting position of `1` instead of `0`, so the first position will be `1`, the second `2`, and so on.

Basically the whole point of this is to have fun with recursion, and to try and think about different ways to solve the same problem.
